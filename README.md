ðŸ“š Internship Practice Assignments â€“ Celebal Technologies
Welcome to the repository that showcases all the practice assignments I completed during my internship at Celebal Technologies. This internship provided me with an incredible opportunity to strengthen my programming skills and dive into the world of Python and Data Science through real-world-inspired tasks and self-driven learning.

ðŸš€ Overview
During the internship, I focused on:

Building a strong foundation in Python programming

Understanding the basics of Data Science and how Python can be used in data-driven tasks

Applying programming logic to solve a variety of practice problems

Gaining familiarity with writing clean, structured, and readable code

Although I worked mostly with core Python, I also got introduced to how Python can be used to perform simple data manipulations and solve analytical problems â€” forming the bridge between basic programming and data science thinking.
